Dali-HoloLens
-------
Dali-HoloLens is a Windows application written in C#. When run on the HoloLens, Dali-HoloLens gives the user the ability to annotate their space by placing instances of Dali-HoloLens around their environment with labels that note what they are marking. When used in combination with Dali-iOS, its sister application, Dali-HoloLens can fetch notes, alerts, and task lists added by Dali-iOS and create holographic versions of these annotations that will automatically be placed alongside the originally placed hologram labels.

Motivation
--------
This project explores possible uses for Microsoft's new HoloLens for environments. The application is general enough to be used in various spaces from marking your personal house for incoming guests (and alerting your guests to the nuances of the house) to marking an office space so that a contractor can see what needs fixing.
