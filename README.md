## Dali-HoloLens

This Microsoft HoloLens application together with the [Dali-Platform](https://github.com/att-innovate/dali) can be used to augment any space, like an office, apartment, plant, or a datacenter.

The user first creates **marks** at important locations using this application. Those marks can then be **annotated** through the [Dali-Mgmt](https://github.com/att-innovate/dali-mgmt) application. Afterwards those newly **augmented** spaces can be enjoyed using this same HoloLens application.

This project contains:

- [Source code](Dali/) for the Dali HoloLens application.
- Documentation regarding installation of the [HoloLens SDK](docs/installation-hololens-sdk.md).
- Documentation for [building and deploying](docs/installation-dali.md) the Dali-HoloLens application.
- And a simple [Demo Scenario](docs/demo.md).

For additional information regarding the Dali platform in general please refer to [github.com/att-innovate/dali](https://github.com/att-innovate/dali).
