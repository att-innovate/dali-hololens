## HoloLens SDK Installation
Detailed information can be found on Microsoftâ€™s [Tool](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/install_the_tools) and [Developer](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/hololens/developers) sites.

### Install Windows 10, 64bit
If you run everything on an Apple computer you will either have to install Windows on the [Boot Camp](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201468) partition, or install it under [Fusion for Mac](http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion.html). Fusion for Mac is needed for the required support for Hyper-V for the HoloLens emulator.

### Install HoloLens SDK
- Install Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 or [Visual Studio 2017](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads).
- Install [HoloLens Emulator](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/using_the_hololens_emulator)
- Verify that Git is [installed](https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/install-and-set-up-git/).
- Installation of [Unity 5.5](https://store.unity.com/download) and [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk) is optional and not required for the [Dali-Platform](https://github.com/att-innovate/dali).

### Install Dali-HoloLens
